1. I have used mean stack(sample app downloaded from the website) to build up this application

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
1. run mongodb server by using mongod command (command prompt) and make sure the server is listening at 27017
2. go to your project root directory 
3. in nodejs command prompt type npm install( will install all the dependencies required for the project)
4. type gulp (makes the server run in the port 3000)
5. open brower and type www./localhost:3000
6. the application will run in your broswer
